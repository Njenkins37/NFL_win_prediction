# NFL_win_prediction
Machine Learning algorithm that will make a prediction regarding whether an NFL team will win. It does not predict how many points or points allowed a team will produce. 

What I learned: 
  * utilizing functions to make code more robust and efficient
  * RandomForestClassifier rationale and why it should be utilized in this scenario
  * dataframe object in pandas
